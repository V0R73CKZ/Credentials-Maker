How to use the Creds_Maker.sh bash script:

1. be sure that all of the dependencies are installed before running the "Creds_Maker.sh" script by opening the terminal and changing the directory (cd) to the location that the "Install_Dependencies.sh" file is stored in, then running "bash Install_Dependencies.sh".
2. import all of your SAM and SYSTEM file pairs to a location of your choosing. (I recommend using the desktop)
3. Rename the SAM file in the first pair to be "SAM1" and the SYSTEM file to be "SYSTEM1". Do the same for as many pairs that you have, making sure that you increase the number at the end by 1 for each pair.
4. Put the Creds_Maker.sh bash script into the same location as your SAM and SYSTEM files.
5. Open the terminal and change the directory (cd) to the same location as your SAM and SYSTEM files.
6. Type the following command into the terminal "bash Creds_Maker.sh" and wait until the Creds.txt file is created.
